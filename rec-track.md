WCAG conformance test - rec track
=================================


Introduction
============



Problem Description
===================

- Reduce confusion of accessibility interpretations, both by experts and accessibility novices.



Open Questions
==============

- Who should lead this group (Chair / co-chair)
- How can we get a meaningful result in a reasonable amount of time?
- What rulesets are already out there?
- How do we decide which (parts of) rule sets can be used?
- How can we confirm the accuracy of rules?
- Which parts should be standardized
- How should the work be organized? Auto-WCAG CG, WCAG TF, ERT WG, other?


Objective
=========

- come up with an approach that will create said conformance rules
- Deliver (useful) results in a meaningful timespan (2 years?)


Proposed Approach
=================


Breaking up the work in meaningful chunks
-----------------------------------------

Possible chunks:
- Template for rules
- Selector per rule
- Breaking up the rule into different 'solutions' (As axe checks?)
